About how to lose 4 weeks with this Kaggle - competition

This is my work for the **machine learning** signature of my Official Master about BigData and Business Analytics at Universidad Complutense de Madrid. 

Here you won't find any crazy feature engineering, or data manipulation to get a high score at the [Kaggle - Titanic competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic), just work about all the different algorithms we have seen, and how to work with them.

## Folders Structure
```
root -> all the code files, the data, and main/this document
|___img -> all the images used in this document
|___mod -> all the models developed during the exercise
|___sub -> all the submissions made in Kaggle
|___tab -> all the tables used in this document
```

## Document explanation
**Documento** is the main document, it's about 30 pages and you can read it if you want to know about my work, but **it'is written in spanish**.
The `.R` files are linked with some document sections as shown below:
* **V01** :arrow_forward: 2 Limpieza de datos, 3 Selección de variables y 4.1 Regresión Logística
* **V02** :arrow_forward: 4.2 Perceptron Multicapa (MLP)
* **V03** :arrow_forward: 4.3 Árboles de decision
* **V04** :arrow_forward: 4.5 _Bagging_ y _Random Forest_: Just about _bagging_
* **V05** :arrow_forward: 4.6 _Bagging_ y _Random Forest_: Just about _random forest_
* **V06** :arrow_forward: 4.6 _Gradient Boosting_
* **V07** :arrow_forward: 4.7 _XGBoost_
* **V08** :arrow_forward: 4.8 Máquinas de vectores de soporte (SVM)
* **V10_predGenerator** :arrow_forward: After a few errors I have needed this code to rebuild some files. 
* **V11** :arrow_forward: 5.1 _Clustering_ de observaciones, 5.1.1 _K-Means_ y 5.1.2 Jerárquico
* **V12** :arrow_forward: 5.2.1 _Naive_ Bayes
